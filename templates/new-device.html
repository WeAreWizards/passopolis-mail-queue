  <body>
    <p>Hi there,

    <p>A new device contacted us. For additional safety we'd like you to confirm that this device really belongs to you by clicking the following link:

    <p>#{serverBase}/mitro-core/user/VerifyDevice?#{urlEncodeVars [("token", messageExtra), ("token_signature", messageToken), ("user", messageUser)]}

    <p>Please ignore this message if you didn't use any new devices recently.

    <p>All the best & stay safe,
    <p>Team Passopolis
